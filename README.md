# InstaLogIn
instagram login page with backend, in which frontend page is looks same as instagram login page and if user logged in with this page the username and password
of that user will be coming to your database. this is only for fun so do not use this to harm somebody. and i also request all users to logged in for instagram
from another source other than instagram only if that source is trusted by instagram.
